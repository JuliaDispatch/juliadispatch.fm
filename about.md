# About Julia Dispatch

(Last updated: {{ fill fd_mtime }})

In the summer of 2024, Michael has been ready for a change of pace.
He's realized his social skills are better than his programming skills,
so he should use that to help Julia.
At JuliaCon in Eindhoven, he's approached Chris about growing the ecosystem
by community work and outreach, maybe starting with a podcast?
Little did he know that Chris had been thinking about starting a Julia podcast
for a while by then.
It was the missing spark for ignition.
The two got to work immediately and here we are.
