He&#39;s realized his social skills are better than his programming skills, so he should use that to help Julia. At JuliaCon in Eindhoven, he&#39;s approached Chris about growing the ecosystem by community work and outreach, maybe starting with a podcast? Little did he know that Chris had been thinking about starting a Julia podcast for a while by then. It was the missing spark for ignition. The two got to work immediately and here we are.</p> <h2 id=your_hosts ><a href="#your_hosts" class=header-anchor >Your hosts</a></h2> <p>Julia has a rich and diverse community. You, too, could help us tell its story and introduce us to others. We&#39;d love to hear from you: send us your episodes or co-host with us.
