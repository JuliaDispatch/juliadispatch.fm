  <p>Today, we're joined by Stefan Krastanov who is not only the main developer of QuantumClifford.jl, but also the author of the "This month in Julia world" newsletter. Stefan shares with us what passions him about physics, the combination of mathematical concepts and hands-on signal processing and what attracted him to Julia. And he confides in us how the Julia newsletter is a productive form of procrastination, how his own appreciation and understanding grew from being the newsletter editor, and how important it is to improve the communication and documentation to make a technology appealing, in particular to new comers.</p>
<p>Stefan Krastanov is an assistant professor of at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Before that, he was a postdoc at MIT/Harvard and obtained his PhD in physics at the Yale Quantum Institute. Stefan works on the design, control, and optimization of quantum hardware for computation and networking, from its analog physical description up to the compilation of error-corrected logical circuitry running on it. His research centers around leaky abstraction boundaries between the many layers of technologies making up the field of quantum computing and quantum information science. To this end, he has authored multiple related Julia packages. And Stefan is the author of the "This month in Julia world" newsletter.</p>
