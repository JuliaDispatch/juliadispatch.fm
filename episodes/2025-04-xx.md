Today we're joined by Simon Christ who is "the computer guy in a biological department". Moving from rock solid C, advancing to C++, he discovered Julia when he had been frustrated enough by his prior programming experiences. Simon has fixed the PGF backend for `Plots.jl` and soon after found himself to have become the maintainer for all the backends. Simon shares with us his experience about maturing and maintaining a foundational package in the ecosystem and why now it's the right time to work on a major version update. We also talk about the `Plots.jl` publication, the importance of reproducible science and package maintenance, and which colors should not be on plots.

Simon Christ is a research software engineer at the Institute of Cell Biology and Biophysics at the Leibniz University of Hannover. He has obtained a PhD in biological physics in 2020. Simon is the maintainer of `Plots.jl`, one of the most well-known plotting libraries in Julia. He has also published a paper about `Plots.jl` in the Journal of Open Research Software.
