We start the year with a first: first time Chris and Michael meet a stranger through Julia Dispatch. Today, we have Kyle Conel on the show who is the main developer of the game engine `JulGame`. Kyle shares with us how an early passion about video games has made him switch majors in college to become a software developer. He talks about how he's learning by doing, how you can start in Julia with an object-oriented mind set and only later take full advantage of the multiple dispatch paradigm, and his plans to (eventually) publish a game developed in Julia to Steam.

Kyle Conel is a professional software engineer, currently working at Atlassian. In his spare time, though, his passion is game development. He's stumbled across Julia via a random Google search in 2021 and he's started to create a game engine in Julia. He shares his development progress and some insights via his social media accounts on Twitch and Youtube.

Apologies for the audio quality during the first 20 or so minutes of this episode. Michael needs to get better headphones.
