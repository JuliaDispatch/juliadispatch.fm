We start the year with a first: first time Chris and Michael meet a stranger through Julia Dispatch. Today, we have Kyle Conel on the show who is the main developer of the game engine `Julgame.jl`. Kyle shares with us how an early passion about video games has made him switch majors in college to become a software developer. He talks about how he's learning by doing, how you can start in Julia with an object-oriented mind set and only later take full advantage of the multiple dispatch paradigm, and his plans to (eventually) publish a game developed in Julia to Steam.

Apologies for the audio quality during the first 20(?) minutes of this episode. Michael needs to get better headphones.
