  <p>We start the year with a first: first time Chris and Michael meet a stranger through Julia Dispatch. Today, we have Kyle Conel on the show who is the main developer of the game engine <code>JulGame</code>. Kyle shares with us how an early passion about video games has made him switch majors in college to become a software developer. He talks about how he's learning by doing, how you can start in Julia with an object-oriented mind set and only later take full advantage of the multiple dispatch paradigm, and his plans to (eventually) publish a game developed in Julia to Steam.</p>
<p>Kyle Conel is a professional software engineer, currently working at Atlassian. In his spare time, though, his passion is game development. He's stumbled across Julia via a random Google search in 2021 and he's started to create a game engine in Julia. He shares his development progress and some insights via his social media accounts on Twitch and Youtube.</p>
<p>Apologies for the audio quality during the first 20 or so minutes of this episode. Michael needs to get better headphones.</p>
