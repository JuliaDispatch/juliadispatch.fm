We're back from our surprising hiatus with a very exciting round: Firoozeh, Leticia and Skylar. Their Julia journeys crossed in their engagement with the Julia Gender Inclusive and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives. We briefly talk about their personal stories before delving into the inclusiveness topic. We discuss the impression and perspective of female participants at a so far male-dominated JuliaCon. The ladies share with us all the activities they have been involved in. And we dive into what problem's they perceive and how everybody in the community can help make Julia a more inclusive community.

Firoozeh Dastur is a theoretical mathematician specializing in algebraic and tropical geometry with a strong focus on leveraging computer algebra systems for advanced mathematical research. Her other interests include high-performance computing (HPC) tools, with a particular goal of making distributed computing accessible to all domain scientists. As a passionate educator, Firoozeh is committed to fostering an inclusive learning environment that empowers the next generation of researchers and innovators. In her spare time, she develops Julia libraries that reflect her interests in distributed computing and computer algebra systems.

We're still in the process of ironing out our technical gear and setup as you might have noticed. Bear with us. Eventually, we'll have figured it out.
