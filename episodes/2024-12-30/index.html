  <p>It's our final episode-of this year. Today we are joined by Dr. Karandeep Singh who shares his story from gamer to doctor and how the realization "You can continue writing code-just do it in whatever field you go into" has led him to his current role. He then introduces us to the Tidyverse and Tidier.jl, tells us a bit about its origin story and how Tidier.jl being available in Julia might be another good reason to give Julia a try. And he explains how the features of Julia have given Tidier.jl a very Julian flavor.</p>
<p>In the academic world, Karandeep Singh, MD, MMSc is the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Chancellorâ€™s Endowed Chair in Digital Health Innovation and Associate Professor in Biomedical Informatics at UC San Diego, where he also serves as Chief Health AI Officer for UC San Diego Health. In these roles, Dr. Singh leads AI initiatives within the Jacobs Center for Health Innovation and oversees AI strategy and governance for the health system. In the Julia community, Dr. Singh has initiated the TidierOrg, an effort to bring R's Tidyverse ecosystem natively to Julia. Starting only in 2023, TidierOrg now reproduces many of the original Tidyverse's packages with extensive training material in the making.</p>
