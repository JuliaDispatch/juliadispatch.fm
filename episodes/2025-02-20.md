This is a special episode of the Julia Dispatch podcast where we have a panel discussion with climate scientists and Earth observation specialists to talk about Julia. In this episode we talk with a litany of experts in climate modeling, satellite data analysis, and data visualization a multitude of questions like: what inroads has Julia made into the climate sciences community? What are Julia's strengths in this domain? What are the weaknesses and how are they looking to be addressed? What is the current state of climate models being built in Julia and how are they performing against Fortran baselines? And what is the future of large-scale data visualization tools in Julia? Specifically we focus on tools like SpeedyWeather.jl, Makie.jl, Oceananigans.jl, NetCDF.jl, and many many more.
