In this episode, we sit down with Παναγιώτης Γεωργακόπουλος. We discuss the evolution of the Pluto project and the user experience philosophy behind it. Παναγιώτης shares with us some of the technical and design challenges that come with it, but also how far reaching some of these principles can be. And we discuss, how open source projects and community development can come together and reinforce each other. Oh, and Chris' camera has gone on strike half-way through - but see for yourself.

Παναγιώτης Γεωργακόπουλος is a software engineer hailing from Athens, Greece. In his own words: "I've been a software engineer, a business analyst, a consultant, a data entry intern, a waiter and a sailor." In 2020, he has started to contribute to the Pluto ecosystem and has continued to do so ever since. He's currently a software engineer at JuliaHub, working on JuliaSim, Pluto, Julia Web stuff and Ask.AI.
