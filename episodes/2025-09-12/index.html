  <p>Today we're joined by Jesper and Philip from Cognibotics, a Swedish robotics company that has  (co-)developed something truly unique: Juliet, a statically-typed dialect of Julia designed specifically for real-time robot programming, along with its runtime system Romeo. Our guests share their personal journeys to Julia and explain how they've adapted the language for industrial robotics applications. They introduce us to Juliet's fascinating features, including static typing, real-time garbage collection, and perhaps most impressively, reversible robot programming that allows forward and backward program stepping for interactive debugging. The conversation explores how they use multiple dispatch for hardware abstraction across different robot backends and hardware targets, their partnership with Chinese robot manufacturer Estun for real-world deployment, and their approach to real-time systems programming. Jesper and Philip also discuss the technical challenges they've overcome, including optimization constraints and the limitations they've had to accept when adapting multiple dispatch for real-time environments. They share their plans for open source access, educational applications including course development at Lund University, and how their work bridges the gap between academic research and industrial automation.</p>
<p>Jesper and Philip are developers at Cognibotics, a Swedish robotics company focused on advanced robot programming solutions. Their work centers around Juliet, a statically-typed dialect of Julia they've created specifically for real-time robot programming, paired with the Romeo runtime system. Cognibotics has formed partnerships with industrial robot manufacturers including Estun, bringing their innovative programming approach to real-world manufacturing applications. The company is also developing educational programs, including plans for courses at Lund University and beta program access for researchers and developers interested in real-time Julia applications.</p>
