Today, we start a new series. Chris and Michael discuss the contents of the "This month in Julia world - 2025-02".  We cover enhancements to Revise.jl, the introduction of JET.jl as a new language server, advancements in compiling Julia for embedded systems, challenges with multi-threading, improvements in the package manager, and the refactoring of the Julia compiler.

We plan to make this a regular feature. Please let us know what you think about the format.
